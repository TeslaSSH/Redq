Tesla SSH Bot is a Telegram bot for managing users on your server. It allows you perform tedious tasks on your server with ease.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 or above
- Telegram account
- Bot token ( create a bot and get its token using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) )
- Secret key for bot verification (You get it from your server after installing the Bot on it)
- YOU MUST HAVE INSTALLED ANY UDP SCRIPT TO INSTALL THIS BOT, Otherwise, the bot will attempt to first install Tesla SSH UDP Binary on your system.

## Installation
---
1. Go to your telegram account and create a new bot from BotFather. Follow what he tells you to do and when you succeed with the process, he will give you the bot API Token. Copy it and save somewhere for the next step. 

2. Connect to your server using SSH. You can use Termius, Juice SSH or PUTTY if you are not a mobile user.

3. Make sure have root permissions on the server (Recommended)
